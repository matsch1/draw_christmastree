# Minimal RST to HTML converter

I build a converter which does not need an API key or some web interface.
This is needed to work with text containing information you do not want to share with annyone.

# usage
## files
 `input.rst`: containing the restructered text to convert
 `style.html`: containing html style decissions
 `index.html`: output with converted text
 `gotool`: amd64 executable build from go
 `Taskfile.yml`: task automation to build and run the converter
